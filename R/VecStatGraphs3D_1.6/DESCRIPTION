Description: This package performs a 3D statistical analysis, both numerical and graphical, of a set of vectors. Since a vector has three components (a module and two angles) vectorial analysis is performed in two stages: modules are analyzed by means of linear statistics and orientations are analyzed by spherical statistics. Tests and spherical statistic parameters are accompanied by a graphs as: density maps, distribution modules and angles. The tests, spherical statistic parameters and graphs allow us detecting another distribution properties (i.e. anisotropy) and outliers.
